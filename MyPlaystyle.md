### Placement and tactics

## My Pattern

### Pattern I can play (Against right handed)

| ID   | Pattern                                                      | Risk                                                         | To improve                                                   | Trainings                                                    |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A1   | Me: Long serve into BH => higher long ball as return<br />Attack on the long the ball with my VH | 1. Long serves can be attacked<br />2. I have an open VH when I move to my BH<br />3.

Placement and spin of long services | 1. Me: Long serve to BH => Wide VH/ Wide BH<br />Hard attack to try to win the point |
| A2   | Me: Short serve into BH => short into BH<br />BH TS/Flip to the Elbow => Higher return <br />Finsiher | 1. Im less prepared for returns into my VH<br />2. Longer returns are harder to TS and TS is weaker | 1. More consistency of my BH TS<br />2. Being better prepared by standing better.<br /> Also being prepared of returns to my VH | 1. Me: Short serve into BH  and get into position <br />=> return to BH (sometimes into VH)<br />BH TS/Flip to elbow => block<br />Go for winner |
| A3   | Me: Short RPS side BS or TS => Long into VH<br />VH TS into middle or BH | 1. Can be played into wide VH<br />2. Can be attacked or flipped | 1. Consistency of VH TS of returns<br />2. BH TS against returns<br />3. Movement when moving from BH to VH | 1. Me: RPS into BH or middle => return to VH (sometimes middle )<br />VH TS into BH or Elbow |

### Pattern I have to improve (Against right handed)

| B1   | me: BH TS in push on line to VH => block into BH<br />BH TS/HIT into wide BH | 1. My ball in the wide VH might get attacked <br />2. Block into my wide VH<br /> | 1. My second BH TS diagonal is not consistence<br />2. Placement of the first BH TS | 1. Opp: short serve <br />short return => push into my BH<br />BH TS on line => block into BH (sometimes VH)<br />BH TS diagonal |
| B2   | Play in the VH in a BH - BH rally                            | 1. A hard VH topspin <br />2. Ball might get to long         | 1. Placement<br />2. Speed                                   | 1. BH - BH rally => me: BH TS/HIT into VH <br />2. Opp: short serve <br />push BH => push BH <br />BH TS into BH <br /> |
| B3   | Return a serve long into the opponents VH => TS into middle or VH<br />CounterTS | 1. A strong VH can attack the ball so I don't get it<br />2. VH attacks down the line are harder to return | 1. Placement <br />2. Speed<br />3. Spin of the push         | 1. Opp: BS serve into my VH<br />long push into the VH => 1.1 Topspin into VH <br />counterTS<br />1.2 TS into BH <br />Block into wide BH |

### Pattern I have to learn (Against right handed)

| Id   | Pattern                                                      | Risk                                                         | To Improve                                                   | Training                                                     |

| C1   | me: TS into VH => block into wide VH<br />VH TS on line into BH => Block into wide BH<br />**BH TS/HIT** | 1.  BH TS/HIT left from my body is not strong and not consistence<br /> | 1. ususally I would play a save choop but I want also be able to attack this balls | 1. me: VH TS from BH to BH => block into VH<br />VH TS on line into BH => block into wide BH<br />**BH TS**<br /> |
| C2   | 1. VH Flip **Pattern not clear yet**                         | 1. Can be attacked when placement or speed is bad            | 1. Placement and speed of VH flip<br />2. Flip in general    | 1.  Opp: short serve into my VH<br />VH flip<br />2. Me serve short => short return into my VH <br />VH flipp |



## My Strategies

1. Use a mix of the pattern G2 and G3 to pretend that you can open very strong with VH and BH on any ball
2. Start matches with Strategy 1 to check how the opponent returns this kind of serves and if the strategy could work

3. Improve BH to have more speed and better placement to prepare your VH
