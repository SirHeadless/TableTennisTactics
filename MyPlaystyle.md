### Placement and tactics

| Serve    | Placement | Tactics                                 | Risk                                                         | Play against           |
| -------- | --------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Backspin | BH        | Spin the ball with the BH into the body | 1. The opponent flips or topspins the ball<br />2. I'm less prepared for balls into my FH | Players with weak BH   |
| Backspin | FH        | Play next ball into long BH             | A push long into my FH                                       | Players with weak VH   |
| Topspin  | long BH   | Attack the ball hard with the FH        | 1. I miss the hard FH quite often <br />2. Ball to attack    | Against weak BH        |
| Topspin  | short     | Attack the ball hard                    | Flip or block into my FH                                     | Players with weak flip |
| Topspin  | Elbow     | Attack with the FH                      | Can be played into my long FH                                |                        |
| Topspin  | VH        | Attack the ball with VH or BH           | Risky ball because most players have strong VH               |                        |
| Side-Top | BH        | Attack hard with VH                     | 1. Goes often very wide into my backhand so I leave<br />my VH open when attacking<br />2. Can be attacked |                        |
| Side-Top | Elbow     | Attack hard with VH                     | ?                                                            |                        |
| Side-Top | VH        | Attack with VH or BH                    | Risky ball because most players have strong VH               |                        |
| Side-US  | BH        | Attack with VH                          | Risky because it goes longer and it is easier to loop        |                        |
| Side-US  | Elbow     | Attack with VH                          | Risky ball when the opponent moves fast                      | Slow players           |
